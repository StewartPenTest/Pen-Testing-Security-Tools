Pen-Testing-Security-Tools
==========================

Place to keep track of my very basis scripts used in IT Security Projects.
These scripts and tools are used on my pen testing projects as well as PCI DSS projects.
You can follow me on twitter https://twitter.com/stewart_fey as well as sign up on my <a href="https://www.pciqsatalk.com"> PCI Compliance Security Blogs</a> or my <a href="https://blackboxauditor.com"> IT Audit and Compliance Tool Site</a>

<b>Look for more security tools to come.</b>
